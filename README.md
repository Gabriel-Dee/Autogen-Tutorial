## Autogen-Tutorial
This Repository introduces AutoGen, a framework developed by Microsoft for building multi-agent LLM applications. It explains how AutoGen simplifies the development of complex, interactive workflows involving agents with different capabilities and expertise. The lecture also provides an overview of LLMs, their capabilities, and the concept of tokenization, highlighting the importance of context length and cost considerations for different model options. 

#### Highlights
- 🤖 **AutoGen streamlines multi-agent LLM application development.**
- 🤝 **Agents interact with each other, following various conversational patterns.**
- 💬 **Agents can represent real-world entities, LLMs, or custom components.**
- 🧠 **LLMs process input text as tokens, with context length defining their memory capacity.**
- 💰 **Different models offer varying capabilities and cost implications.**
